This project will be used to set up a back end server which you can use in later projects to build the front end. It will help to get into the habit of the concept known as the "contract" in which front and back end developers can work in parallel of each other by having a given application and its api behave a certain way during the process for better efficiancy.

Thanks for checking out my code on GitHub.
